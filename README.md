# Asteroids Game

### Current State of Game
- Ship can rotate left and right
- Ship can move forward and backward
- Ship can shoot bullets
- Asteroids are randomly generated (large, medium, small)
- Asteroids split into two asteroids of the next smaller size
- Split asteroids move in a semi-random direction
- Split asteroids move faster than original asteroid
- Small asteroids disappear when hit
- Bullet disappears when it hits an asteroid

### Future Improvements:
- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
